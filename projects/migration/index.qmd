As part of a consultancy engagement, I audited a large SAS codebase to help a client understand the feasibility and risk profile of migrating to R. The codebase was business-critical and had grown organically over many years.

What I worked on:
- Static code analysis of SAS codebase to estimate size and complexity (e.g. SQL-style vs. custom PROC logic)
- Identified areas where statistical methods or parameter defaults might behave differently in R
- Delivered a scoped migration plan to help inform budget, risk, and staffing decisions

The audit helped the client avoid assumptions about direct conversion and provided a structured way to evaluate next steps.
