I led a team within a large organisation responsible for maintaining an internal Shiny app used to manage R package installation requests. The codebase had become increasingly fragile and hard to maintain, with tightly coupled logic and growing technical debt.

What I worked on:
- Refactored reactive logic to simplify control flow and heavily modularised code to support maintainability
- Introduced testing strategies and CI workflows
- Improved onboarding for new developers by making the codebase easier to understand

The changes made the application significantly more maintainable and safer to extend as the team evolved, reducing development time considerably.
