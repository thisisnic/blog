Resources for learning how to work with LLMs in R:

-   **Comprehensive:** The [Athlyticz course](#athlyticz) covers ML with tidymodels through to LLMs, RAG, and deployment.

-   **Self-paced:** My [LLMs in R course](#self-paced) if you want to learn at your own pace.

-   **Cohort-based:** My [Practical AI for R course](#cohort) with live sessions and group learning.

## Athlyticz: ML and LLMs in R {#athlyticz}

A comprehensive course I developed with Christoph Scheuch covering the full journey from machine learning fundamentals to building LLM-powered applications in R.

The course covers:

-   ML foundations with tidymodels: model evaluation, resampling, tuning, preprocessing
-   Regression and classification models including neural networks
-   Model deployment with vetiver and orbital
-   Working with LLMs using ellmer
-   Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for building apps with your own data

Aimed at R users comfortable with the tidyverse who want to build and deploy ML and LLM applications.
