Hi, I'm Nic! I help people level up their R skills and data teams work more efficiently with R. Sometimes that's scaling up data pipelines that have ground to a halt, and sometimes it's figuring out how to use LLMs in analytics workflows.

I've taught thousands of people through online courses, sold-out workshops at EARL and posit::conf, and I now run open-access courses for individuals alongside private training for organisations.

I also take on consulting projects. If you're interested in working together, you can get in touch by emailing me at: [nic\@ncdatalabs.com](mailto:nic@ncdatalabs.com).

## Services

### Public Training Courses

I regularly run publicly accessible training courses on working with Arrow in R, and LLMs in R. Details on how to sign up for my next courses coming soon!

### Private Courses for Organisations

Production-Ready R Program

Tailored training for teams who need to get R code running reliably in production. Modules include:

-   Big Data in R with Arrow and Parquet
-   LLMs in R
-   CI/CD and deployment
-   (other topics as needed)

If you need a bespoke training course tailored to your organisation's needs, get in touch and we can discuss your needs and where I can help.

### General R Consulting and Training

I'm also available for more general R and data science consulting and team support. Whether you need help with an one-off project or regular support on a monthly retainer, get in touch for a free discovery call.

## Resources

I've been an active contributor to the Apache Arrow R package, where I've worked on implementing features, acting as package maintainer, managing complex build configuration, and extending dplyr support to Arrow. This work has influenced how I approach performance, reproducibility, and maintainability - both in open source and in client projects.

In 2024, I co-authored Scaling Up With R and Arrow, which was published by CRC Press and also available online at arrowrbook.com.
