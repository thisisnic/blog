Hi, I'm Nic! I'm a data scientist, software engineer, and R enthusiast. I am part of the team who maintain the arrow R package and co-author of [Scaling Up with R and Arrow](https://arrowrbook.com/).

I also provide **professional, tailored consulting and training services** to help organisations unlock the full potential of R and data analysis. With extensive experience in **developing Shiny apps and dashboard**, **modernising legacy code**, **building R packages**, and **designing data visualization and automated reporting tools**, I focus on delivering effective solutions that meet specific client needs and help you get more from your data.

### **Consulting Expertise**

-   **Shiny app development**: End-to-end creation of interactive dashboards, including:

    -   A Shiny portal designed to monitor the status of genomic analysis pipelines for a large-scale healthcare organization.

    -   An app built to automate data cleaning and visualization for a major pharmaceutical company.

    -   Optimization and redesign of an existing Shiny app for a semiconductor manufacturer, applying best software engineering practices.

-   **Legacy code modernization**: Transitioning from SAS or Excel to R for streamlined analysis.

-   **Diverse technical solutions**: A complete Python-based NLP solution, including a backend and dashboard, to analyze online reviews and extract themes and aggregated sentiments for a university project.

Open to both short-term problem-solving projects and longer-term collaborations.

### Training Services

-   Beginner to advanced topics, including **R fundamentals**, **Apache Arrow for big data**, and **AI-powered workflows**.

-   Customised courses tailored to your needs, ensuring relevance and hands-on learning.

-   Proven track record, with workshops taught at **EARL**, **posit::conf** and online courses developed for major platforms.

### **Why Work with Me?**

-   Trusted reputation in the R community, with open-source contributions and public speaking engagements at industry-leading events.

-   Flexible, remote-friendly services, ensuring cost-effective, high-quality results.

-   Transparent communication, with clear deliverables, timelines, and scope management.

I'm currently accepting new clients and open to partnerships for larger projects. Whether you're looking to **upskill your team**, **modernise your workflows**, or **tackle a specific data challenge**, I'd love to discuss how I can help.
