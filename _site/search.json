The packages I’m most interested in here are:\nI’m also interested in knowing when packages that folks use for vaguely similar purposes have been updated; I like to be up-to-date on this as sometimes people ask me about how things compare.\nPreviously, I’d occasionally caught glimpses of things via social media, but I wanted a more methodical approach, and so decided to write a GitHub Actions CRON job that does this. Now, when any of the packages on my list is updated, I receive an email that looks a little like this:\nIn this blog post, I’m going to walk through how I created this repository, and how you can do the same for your own packages."

    "text": "The GitHub Actions Workflow\nIn the next sections, I’ll walk through the GitHub Actions workflow, step by step, explaining what each bit does.\n\nScheduling\nThe start of the workflow looks like this:\nname: Check for package updates\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string\n    - cron:  '00 1 * * *'\nIt has a name, and the schedule is set to run every day at 1am UTC. The cron syntax is a bit weird, but there’s a handy crontab guru that can help you figure out what you need to put in here.\n\n\nJobs\nNext, we set up the different jobs we want to run. I want 1 job to run for each package.\nI used GitHub Copilot to help me with some of the syntax here; it was fantastic when I just added a comment describing what I’d like to be added, and then it filled it in. This wasn’t a perfect process as you have to know what to ask, and setting up the list of packages to work with was tricky, as I didn’t quite have the understanding of how matrices (which can run code in parallel) interacted with arrays (for specifying multiple inputs for each parallel job) as I hadn’t used this before. A bit of googling and a skim of StackOverflow and I got there pretty quickly though.\njobs:\n  compare-hashes:\n    name: ${{matrix.package.name}} updates\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    strategy:\n        matrix:\n          package: \n            [\n                { name: dbplyr, file: dbplyr-NEWS.md, url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/dbplyr/main/NEWS.md' }, \n                { name: lubridate, file: lubridate-NEWS.md, url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/lubridate/main/NEWS.md' },\n                { name: dplyr, file: dplyr-NEWS.md, url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/dplyr/main/NEWS.md'}, \n                { name: data.table, file: data.table-NEWS.md, url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdatatable/data.table/master/NEWS.md'},\n                { name: dtplyr, file: dtplyr-NEWS.md, url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/dtplyr/main/NEWS.md'},\n                { name: duckdb-r, file: duckdb-r-NEWS.md, url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/main/NEWS.md'},\n                { name: r-polars, file: r-polars-NEWS.md, url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pola-rs/r-polars/main/NEWS.md'},\n                { name: stringr, file: stringr-NEWS.md, url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/stringr/main/NEWS.md'},\n                { name: duckplyr, file: duckplyr-NEWS.md, url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duckdblabs/duckplyr/main/NEWS.md'},\n                { name: tidypolars, file: tidypolars-NEWS.md, url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/etiennebacher/tidypolars/main/NEWS.md'},\n            ]\nThe runs-on specifies the operating system to run the job on, and the permissions section allows the job to write to the repo. The strategy section is where we set up the matrix of packages to work with. Each package has a name, a file name, and a URL to the changelog. The name of the job is set to the name of the package.\n\n\nSteps\nNext, we set up the steps that we want to run. The first step is to check out the repo we are working in, and get the hash of the relevant changelog file I have stored in my repo. This is saved to the GITHUB_OUTPUT environment variable, which is a file that is shared between all the steps in the job.\n    steps:\n        - name: Checkout code\n          uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        - name: Get local file hash\n          id: local-hash\n          run: echo \"local_hash=$(md5sum changelogs/${{ matrix.package.file }} | cut -d ' ' -f 1)\" &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT\nNext, I want to get the hash of the latest version of the package’s changelog file. I do this by downloading the file, and then getting the hash of the downloaded file. This is also saved to the GITHUB_OUTPUT environment variable.\n        - name: Get remote file\n          id: remote-file\n          run: |\n                  mkdir tmp\n                  curl -s ${{ matrix.package.url }} &gt; tmp/${{ matrix.package.file }}#\n        - name: Get remote file hash\n          id: remote-hash\n          run: echo \"remote_hash=$(md5sum tmp/${{ matrix.package.file }} | cut -d ' ' -f 1)\" &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT\nFinally, I want to compare the hashes of the two files. If they’re different, I want to update the changelog in my repo. I do this by setting up a conditional step that only runs if the hashes are different. In this case, I’m setting the git config, copying the new changelog to my repo, and then committing and pushing the changes.\n        - name: Update changed files\n          if: ${{ steps.local-hash.outputs.local_hash != steps.remote-hash.outputs.remote_hash }}\n          run: |\n            echo \"Hashes do not match!\"   \n            git config --global user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n            git config --global user.name \"GHA Bot\"\n            cp tmp/${{ matrix.package.file }} changelogs/${{ matrix.package.file }}\n            git add changelogs/${{ matrix.package.file }}\n            git pull --ff-only\n            git commit -m \"Update ${{matrix.package.name}} changelog\"\n            git push\nFinally, I want to send an email notification if the changelog has been updated. I do this by setting up a conditional step that only runs if the hashes are different. I use the dawidd6/action-send-mail action to send the email. I set up a few secrets in my repo to store the email address and password, and then use those in the action. I also set up the subject and body of the email using the package name and URL.\nThe username and password are not my actual email address and password; instead, you can set up an app password for your email account, and use that instead, which is more secure.\n        - name: Send email notification\n          if: ${{ steps.local-hash.outputs.local_hash != steps.remote-hash.outputs.remote_hash }}\n          uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v3\n          with:\n            server_address: smtp.gmail.com\n            server_port: 465\n            username: ${{ secrets.MAIL_USERNAME }}\n            password: ${{ secrets.MAIL_PASSWORD }}\n            subject: \"${{matrix.package.name}} update\"\n            body: \"${{matrix.package.name}} has been updated! Please check the changelog at ${{matrix.package.url}}.\"\n            to: ${{ secrets.MAIL_RECIPIENT }}\n            from: ${{ secrets.MAIL_USERNAME}}\nAnd that’s it!

    "text": "Conclusion\nI really enjoyed working on this and learning more about GitHub Actions. This has proved to be a useful tool, though there are a few improvements that could be made:\n\nsome packages update their changelog more frequently than others and so some of the updates I get feel a bit spammy. I could fix this by running my CRON job on a weekly rather than daily schedule.\nI don’t use this as much as I anticipated because some changes are really minor, and I tend to skim them and not pay too much attention. Again, a different CRON frequency could probably help here.\nI’m more interested in some packages than others. {dplyr}, {lubridate}, and {stringr} are the most important, whereas others are just a “nice to have” here. I could separate these out into different jobs, and run them on different schedules.\n\nAnyway, I’d love to hear your thoughts - how do you keep up to date with changes in R packages? Do you have any suggestions for improvements to this workflow? Let me know! Get in touch via Mastodon or LinkedIn."

    "text": "Context - adding a feature to daisyuiwidget\nI’m currently collaborating with Charlotte Hadley on an R package called daisyuiwidget, which is a htmlwidgets package.\n\nhtmlwidgets\nCharlie and I both really love htmlwidgets, which are used to wrap JavaScript libraries and work with them from R. They can be used in HTML outputs like Quarto documents and Shiny apps.\nOne example of a htmlwidgets package is DT, which can be used to create interactive tables. You can see an example below.\n\nlibrary(DT)\n\npackages &lt;- data.frame(\n    package = c(\"htmlwidgets\", \"leaflet\", \"plotly\", \"DT\"),\n    first_release = as.Date(c(\"2014-12-09\", \"2015-06-24\", \"2015-11-17\", \"2015-06-09\")\n    )\n)\n\nDT::datatable(packages)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the excellent features about packages like DT is that they can go beyond just displaying outputs. If you include a DT table in a Shiny app and have enabled “row selection”, then the JavaScript code for the table can pass the index of the user’s selected row back to R. This then can be used in other components of the app, for example, displaying information relevant to the user’s selection.\n\n\ndaisyuiwidget\nThe goal with daisyuiwidget is to create a new htmlwidgets package, using LLMs - we’ll be talking more about this in our joint presentation at Shiny in Production later on this year.\nWe decided to create a wrapper for the daisyUI library which has a feature where it can be used to create timelines like the one below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project was at the point where the package successfully created a timeline from a data.frame input. The next task for me to do was implement the functionality for timeline event selection, with the goal that when a user clicks on an event in the timeline, an input variable in R is updated, which then can be hooked up to other bits of Shiny reactivity.\nThis is what I’ll be discussing below - how I got ChatGPT to help with this, but with helping me learn how to do it myself, and not just getting the LLM to write the code."

The resulting learning goal was more precise than my original stated aim, and the supporting objectives made for concrete steps to aim for in pursuit of the overall goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to view full conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am looking at how I can get LLMs to help me with a coding task as an intelligent tutor and not just solve the problem for me. My first step is establishing a learning goal or goals. Using the brief below, ask me questions one at a time to help me work out a small set of goals in this exercise.\nEstablish learning goals\nWhen establishing goals for self-directed learning, it’s most important for learners to set SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This approach helps adult learners identify clear learning objectives and stay focused on achieving them.\nGoals should be personalized and align with the learner’s interests, motivations, and expected learning outcomes. It’s crucial to break down broader objectives into smaller, manageable tasks to make them more achievable.\nAdditionally, learners should consider how their goals relate to their personal and professional contexts, ensuring relevance. Setting a realistic timeline for accomplishing these goals is also essential.\nWhile learners can use tools like ChatGPT to assist in goal-setting, it’s important to remember that the quality of recommendations depends on the information provided by the learner. Therefore, clear communication of interests, motivations, and expectations is crucial when using such tools.\n\n\nLet’s start by grounding this in why you’re doing it.\nQuestion 1: What’s your motivation for using LLMs as a tutor rather than a problem-solver—what do you hope to gain from this approach (e.g., deeper understanding, confidence, skill retention, etc.)?\n\n\nI want to understand how I can take an R package which creates a htmlwidget and adds the correct code so that I can use it in a shiny app and update a variable based on what the user has selected. I want to learn how to do this as I think it’s a useful skill to have. I don’t want an LLM to do it as I won’t know if the code is correct or not and would only have surface level understanding and so would be hard to repeat the skill in future.\n\n\nQuestion 2:\nWhere are you starting from? For example:\n\nHave you ever written your own htmlwidget package from scratch\nDo you already have a specific widget/package in mind?\nHave you previously connected any JS-based input to Shiny reactivity?\n\n(Just answer what’s true for you—this is to calibrate the scope of your learning goal.)\n\n\nI have never written an htmlwidget package from scratch although I do have one I’ve written with an LLM that I’d like to add this functionality to. It creates the widget but doesn’t have the shiny functionality yet. I’ve not done much of this connectivity before, though have worked with packages that implement it themselves.\n\n\nThat gives us a baseline. You’ve got a partial htmlwidget and prior exposure to packages that do this right, but you haven’t yet wired up JS-to-R reactivity yourself.\nQuestion 3:\nWhat exactly do you want the user to select in your widget, and what kind of R-side variable or behavior do you want to update in response? (Try to be concrete—e.g., “user clicks on a bar in a chart, I want to update a reactiveVal() in the server with the bar’s label.”)\n\n\nSo the widget display a timeline of events and I want the user to select an event, and some variable updates. I’ve seen similar functionality in the DT package where the user clicks on a row in a table, and some variable tracks which row is selected and the data from that row. I can’t remember exactly what data it tracks, it could just be the row number and then the user can write a function to extract the data from an underlying data.frame; this is fine too.\n\n\nPerfect—this is concrete enough.\nYou want to let the user select an event from a timeline displayed via your htmlwidget, and capture that selection in the Shiny server logic—ideally as an index or ID you can work with to retrieve more data.\nQuestion 4:\nWhat’s your ideal end state for this learning exercise? For example:\n\nDo you want to be able to reproduce this pattern in other widgets you make?\nAre you aiming to read or modify similar functionality in other packages?\nOr is this just about getting this one widget working?\n\n\n\nIt’s about getting this one working, although I would like to be able to do it again if I ever make another htmlwidgets package.\n\n\nGot it. So the primary goal is getting this specific widget working, and a secondary goal is gaining enough understanding to repeat the pattern if needed.\nQuestion 5:\nWhat’s your time horizon? Do you want to finish this within a day, a week, or are you treating it as an open-ended background task?\n\n\nI’d like to finish this within a few hours and not overcomplicate it\n\n\nGood. A short, focused goal with an emphasis on practical understanding.\nHere’s a draft of your SMART-aligned learning goals based on what you’ve said:\n\nPrimary Learning Goal:\nWithin the next few hours, I want to understand and implement the necessary code to make my existing htmlwidget timeline respond to user interaction in a Shiny app—specifically, capturing a selected event and updating a variable on the server side.\nSupporting Objectives:\n\nIdentify how event selection can be captured in JavaScript and passed to Shiny via Shiny.setInputValue().\nModify the widget’s JS code to emit a Shiny input when a user selects an event.\nTest and verify that the input value is received in Shiny and reflects the expected event ID or index.\nWrite a minimal working Shiny app that uses the widget and displays the selected event value.\n\n\nDo you want to adjust or narrow any part of that before we move to designing how the LLM will help you stay in tutor mode for this?"

    "section": "Step 2 - Locate and Access Resources",
    "text": "Step 2 - Locate and Access Resources\nDuration: 11 minutes\nThe second stage was identifying resources for learning.\nIt started smoothly - ChatGPT asked me if I preferred to learn by reading, watching, or doing, and when I replied “doing” it assured me that it would find code-first resources with working examples - great!\nIt gave me some options about kinds of examples I was interested in, and asked which htmlwidgets packages I was more familiar with so we could use those as examples to look at. At this point it suggested some initial links, but 2 out of the 3 didn’t actually work.\nWhen I complained about this, it gave me some code examples to try out, which I pushed back on, stating I wanted resources to learn from and not ChatGPT-generated code,\nAt this point, it gave me a list of resources, divided into categories and a summary of what it had provided. The links supplied here did all work this time, but there was too much information, and a real risk of overwhelm.\nI began to skim through a few articles, before I remembered that the aim of this step was only to identify resources, and not to deep dive into them quite yet, and so instead I moved onto the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to view full conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the next thing I need to do it find learning resources. Here are the notes I have.\n\nLocate and access resources\n\nWhen it comes to locating and accessing resources for self-directed learning, the most important things to know are:\nAdult learners often struggle with finding available resources, particularly interactive and multimedia materials. This challenge can be a significant barrier to effective self-directed learning.\nLearners should proactively identify a variety of resources beyond those provided by instructors. These can include online articles, videos, multimedia resources, books, journals, publications, blogs, and social media groups related to their learning objectives.\nTools like ChatGPT can assist in recommending relevant external resources based on personalized learning plans. However, learners should be cautious and verify the information provided by such tools.\nIt’s crucial to develop skills in searching for and accessing information, as insufficient technical skills can hinder this process. Improving these skills is an important part of self-directed learning.\n\n\nLet’s approach this systematically.\nQuestion 1:\nDo you learn better by reading, watching, or doing?\n(That’ll help decide whether to focus on docs, code examples, videos, interactive tutorials, etc.)\n\n\nI learn best by doing\n\n\nGreat—so you’ll want code-first resources, ideally with small working examples you can tinker with.\nQuestion 2:\nWhat kind of prior art do you want to learn from? For example:\n\nExisting htmlwidgets that support Shiny inputs (like DT, leaflet, plotly)?\nGeneral tutorials on writing htmlwidgets?\nTutorials or examples specifically about integrating JS events with Shiny via Shiny.setInputValue()?\nOr are you mostly looking for real widget repos to read and adapt?\n\n\n\nItems 1 and 3 on your list look good!\n\n\nGood. Then your resource categories are:\n\nReal htmlwidget packages with Shiny input support — to reverse-engineer and adapt\nTargeted examples or tutorials on using Shiny.setInputValue() inside htmlwidgets\n\nLet’s start with category 1.\nQuestion 3:\nPick one or two widgets you’ve used or are familiar with—ideally ones where clicking/selecting something in the widget updates a Shiny input. (e.g., DT::datatable, plotly::plotlyOutput). Which ones should we dissect?\n\n\nI’m mostly familiar with those two you mention, more so DT then plotly tho\n\n\nPerfect. DT is a solid choice—it’s well-documented, simple enough to follow, and has clean Shiny integration.\nHere’s what I suggest for Category 1 (Prior art):\n\nPrimary resource:\n\nDT GitHub repo – especially inst/htmlwidgets/datatables.js and how it calls Shiny.setInputValue() when rows are selected.\nFocus on how selection is captured (usually via a JS event listener) and how that’s passed back to Shiny.\n\nBackup/contrast resource:\n\nplotly – check srcjs/ for how it emits click or hover events to Shiny. Slightly more complex but good for broader perspective.\n\n\nNow for Category 3 (Targeted examples of Shiny.setInputValue()):\n\n*Mini-tutorials / blogs / gists**:\n\nWinston Chang’s guide on JS &lt;-&gt; Shiny – clear and concise\nDean Attali: Custom inputs – practical advice\nRStudio’s official htmlwidgets Shiny integration doc – short, focused example\n\n\nWant me to fetch code excerpts or links for any of those right now? Or would you rather search through them yourself and come back with questions?\n\n\nThe Dean Attali post looks great and all, but the other two guides links don’t work.\n\n\nYou’re leaning into learning by doing, which means you need hands‑on code examples where you can modify and test.

    "text": "Step 3 - Adopt and Execute Learning Activties\nDuration: 36 minutes\nThe third and final step was the most useful by far!\nOnce again, I pasted in the guide to this step, and ChatGPT created a plan for me containing four items:\n\nReverse-engineer one working widget\nBuild minimal standalone Shiny demo\nAdd minimal event tracking to your widget\nWire the widget into a basic Shiny app\n\nThis was actually pretty impressive; each step contained a goal, the steps required to achieve it, suggestions for how an LLM could help, and a timebox of how long to spend on each activity.\nHere’s the first activity suggested:\n\n🔍 1. Reverse-engineer one working widget\nGoal: Understand how an existing widget (e.g. DT) captures selection and sends it to Shiny.\nActivity:\n\nOpen the DT GitHub repo.\nLocate where Shiny.setInputValue() is used in the JS files (inst/htmlwidgets/datatables.js).\nMake brief notes:\n\nWhat JS event triggers the update?\nHow is the input ID constructed?\nWhat data is passed to Shiny?\n\n\nLLM Role:\n\nAsk ChatGPT to walk you through unfamiliar lines or patterns (e.g. “What’s this event handler doing?” or “What does this argument to setInputValue mean?”).\n\nTimebox: 20–30 minutes.\n\nI walked through each activity, setting a timer on my phone. I found that I completed each in less than the allotted time. I skipped the last activity, as I only required 1-3 to complete the task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to view learning plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, my next step is below\n\nAdopt and Execute Learning Activities\n\nAdopting and executing learning activities is a crucial task in self-directed learning. This step involves developing a specific plan of action that aligns with established goals and available resources.\nLearners should create tailored plans that consider their preferred learning styles and available time for learning. This personalization helps ensure the learning activities are effective and manageable.\nTime-management techniques, such as spaced repetition and active recall, are important to incorporate into the learning plan. These strategies can help learners stay on track and optimize their learning process.\nLearning activities should be diverse and match the learner’s preferred style. This might include visual aids, podcasts, reading materials, or hands-on activities, depending on whether the learner is visual, auditory, reading/writing, or kinesthetic.\nSupplementing core learning activities with additional resources, such as online workshops, can enhance the learning experience and provide different perspectives on the subject matter.\n\n\n🛠️ Execution Plan: LLM-Assisted Learning Without Code Outsourcing\n\n⏱️ Estimated Total Time: ~2–3 hours\n\n\n\n🔍 1. Reverse-engineer one working widget\nGoal: Understand how an existing widget (e.g. DT) captures selection and sends it to Shiny.\nActivity:\n\nOpen the DT GitHub repo.\nLocate where Shiny.setInputValue() is used in the JS files (inst/htmlwidgets/datatables.js).\nMake brief notes:\n\nWhat JS event triggers the update?\nHow is the input ID constructed?\nWhat data is passed to Shiny?\n\n\nLLM Role:\n\nAsk ChatGPT to walk you through unfamiliar lines or patterns (e.g. “What’s this event handler doing?” or “What does this argument to setInputValue mean?”).\n\nTimebox: 20–30 minutes.\n\n\n\n🧪 2. Build minimal standalone Shiny demo\nGoal: Create a toy Shiny app where JS sends a value to R.\nActivity:\n\nUse this Posit guide or RyouReady’s example to build a plain HTML div or button that triggers Shiny.setInputValue() in a browser console or inline JS.\n\nLLM Role:\n\nAsk it to review the minimal app you’ve built and explain/debug if input isn’t showing up server-side.\n\nTimebox: 20 minutes.\n\n\n\n🧱 3. Add minimal event tracking to your widget\nGoal: Modify your widget to track one user interaction and send something to Shiny.\nActivity:\n\nIn your widget’s JS binding, add an event listener (e.g. click/select).\nSend a dummy value to Shiny using Shiny.setInputValue().\nObserve input in input$yourwidget_selected or similar.\n\nLLM Role:\n\nAsk for feedback on the specific event binding you’re trying (“Why isn’t this firing?” or “What selector do I use to bind the click?”).\n\nTimebox: 45–60 minutes.\n\n\n\n🧪 4. Wire the widget into a basic Shiny app\nGoal: End-to-end test: selection in your timeline → reactive output in Shiny.\nActivity:\n\nWrite a basic Shiny app using your widget.\nUse reactivePrint(), observeEvent(), or renderText() to display the selected item.\n\nLLM Role:\n\nAsk it to sanity check your Shiny app logic or spot input ID mismatches.\n\nTimebox: 30 minutes.\n\n\n\nOptional: 🔁 Space repetition (1–2 days later)\nCome back and:\n\nRebuild the Shiny example from scratch.\nAdd a new input (e.g. multiple selection).\nExplain the flow (JS → R) out loud or in a notebook.\n\n\n\n\n✅ How I can help\nYou run the show. Use me like a senior dev standing over your shoulder:\n\n“Explain this line of JS.”\n“This event handler isn’t firing—what’s wrong?”\n“What’s the right selector for this DOM node?”\n“Can you sanity-check this widget binding?”\n“What’s the minimal Shiny app I can use to test this?”\n\n\nWant a markdown checklist version of this plan to copy into your notes?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a lot of interaction between me and ChatGPT here, and I’m not going to paste it all, but essentially, during the time I used it to:\n\nexplain some JavaScript code I didn’t understand by walking me through it line-by-line\nget clarity on how to implement some of its suggestions by asking exactly what it meant\nmultiple rounds of debugging code I had written which didn’t work\nhelping me work out exactly where the change was needed in my own code\n\nIn the last example, ChatGPT didn’t just tell me where to put the code, but walked through the important concepts to reason through the answer. It then asked me questions so that I could work out where in the code the change needed to go. Here’s a snippet from that interaction.\n\n🤔 So… where do you want interactivity?\nLet me ask you this:\n\nOut of everything that’s being created here, what part of the DOM would the user actually click on if they were selecting a timeline event?\n\nOnce we know that, we can talk about how and where to attach the event handler.\n\n\n\nI think they’d click on the timeline-box element\n\n\n\nExactly—that’s the actionable node.\nThat means you’ll want to attach a JS event handler (e.g. .onclick or .addEventListener('click', ...)) to each .timeline-box as it’s created.\nNow a follow-up:\n\nWhen you’re looping over x.events, what info do you need to send back to Shiny when a .timeline-box is clicked? (Think: what identifier, value, or payload do you want to capture?)\n\n\nWe carried on the back and forth like this for a while, with ChatGPT asking me questions to guide me towards the solution. If I got an answer wrong, it replied with an encouraging tone and explained why I was incorrect, and the specific piece of knowledge I was missing.\nEventually, we go to the end of our interaction.\n\nIt’s working!!\n\n\n\nExcellent. That means your widget is now:\n\nRendering cleanly ✅\nSending input to Shiny ✅\nUpdating on click ✅\n\nYou’ve now got the full JS → R feedback loop working in your custom htmlwidget.\n\nIf you want to improve it later, next steps could include:\n\nMaking the selected element visually highlighted (add/remove a CSS class)\nSending richer data to Shiny (e.g. event ID, label, timestamp)\nSupporting multiple selection or deselection\nWriting a unit test or snapshot test for the widget rendering\n\n\n\nBut honestly—you’ve just crossed the hardest barrier. Nice work.\n\n\nAnything else you want to do with it right now?\n\n\nIt sounds like a lot, but this whole experience took around 1 hour from end to end which I found pretty impressive."

It acted like a more senior engineer, talking me through unfamiliar concepts, helping me debug my code, and nudging me towards the right mental model.\n\nLess overhead, faster feedback\nIt helped reduce context-switching and help me stay in flow. I didn’t need to spend time refining my overall goal, deciding what steps to take, and skim through partially relevant resources. By instead being able to focusing solely on writing the code, it prevented the cognitive fatigue of having to switch between “coding” and “planning” mindsets.\n\n\nStill my own work\nCould I have done it without the LLM? Yes, but it would have taken longer, and I would have learned less.\nAlthough I was using an LLM, I was an active participant in my own learning and so felt empowered as a learner. ChatGPT provided scaffolding and support but not all of the answers.\n\n\nWhat I’d change next time\nA reasonable next step to develop this idea further would be to refine the prompts for each stage - the prompts I included were just summaries of the snippets of the article, rather than specific instructions for ChatGPT. In small tasks like this, I’d treat information gathering as part of the task, and collapse steps 2 and 3.\nI found this process really rewarding to try out, and I’d encourage others to give it a go.

In this workshop you will learn how to use Apache Arrow, a multi-language toolbox for working with larger-than-memory tabular data, to create seamless “big” data analysis pipelines with R.\nThe workshop will focus on using the the arrow R package—a mature R interface to Apache Arrow—to process larger-than-memory files and multi-file datasets with arrow using familiar dplyr syntax. You’ll learn to create and use interoperable data file formats like Parquet for efficient data storage and access, with data stored both on disk and in the cloud, and also how to exercise fine control over data types to avoid common large data pipeline problems. This workshop will provide a foundation for using Arrow, giving you access to a powerful suite of tools for performant analysis of larger-than-memory data in R.\nThis course is for you if you:\n\nwant to learn how to work with tabular data that is too large to fit in memory using existing R and tidyverse syntax implemented in Arrow\nwant to learn about Parquet and other file formats that are powerful alternatives to CSV files\nwant to learn how to engineer your tabular data storage for more performant access and analysis with Apache Arrow"

This talk details the creation of a large-scale application, supporting hundreds of concurrent users, making use of the future and promises packages. The 100,000 genomes project is an ambitious exercise that follows on from the Human Genome Project - aiming to put the UK at the forefront of genomic medicine, with the NHS as the first health service in the world to offer precision medicine to patients with rare diseases and cancer. Data is at the heart of this project; not only the outputs of the genomic sequencing, but vast amounts of metadata used to track progress against the 100,000 genome target and the status and path of each case through the sample tracking pipeline. In order to make this data readily available to stakeholders, Shiny was used to create an application containing multiple interactive dashboards. A scaled-up version of the app is being rolled out in early 2019 to a much larger audience to support the National Genomics Informatics Service, with the challenge of creating a complex app capable of supporting so many users without grinding to a halt. In this talk, I will explain why Shiny was the obvious technology choice for this task, and discuss the design decisions which enabled this project’s success."

What’s a good way to get involved, and really learn the internals of an R package? How can I navigate the social dynamics of an open source project?

I feel like my focus will shift a little, away from code, and more towards encouraging new contributors, as well as teaching people how to use the package.\nMost excitingly though, is the book which I am co-authoring!

I made a start on the Udacity C++ Nanodegree, which I completed over half of, but was limited on time and so paused this - I plan to pick it up again next year though. I also tried a more practical approach, and decided to make a PR to the Arrow C++ codebase - one of the PRs I am most proud of this year is this one, adding support for the Substrait cast expression. It was hard, though most of the complexity came from peripheral tasks, like working out how to run the code interactively in the debugger."

After leaving Voltron Data, I’d been working part-time in a contractor capacity, alongside working on the Arrow book, but I decided I wanted to narrow my focus and take some time out for me.\nI’m taking a break and spending the next couple of months focusing on writing. Once most of the book is done, I plan to spend more time on my open source work in general, which will involve teaching and talking about Arrow, as well as pushing forward a few side projects.\nThe most exciting news I’ve had this year is that I applied to the Recurse Center a few weeks ago. RC is like a writer’s retreat for programmers, and attendees spend 12 weeks together working on programming problems of their choice. I want to get to grips with R’s internals, and learn about the C API, as well as levelling up my C++ skills in general. I’m delighted to say that I was accepted to attend this morning, and will be joining the spring batch in late March! I’ve got a ton of ideas for projects I want to work on, but will have to see how much time I ultimately end up having.\nLonger-term - I don’t know. Ultimately, I’d love to get paid to work on open source again, but those opportunities are few and far between. I also have some professional goals I’d like to hit before I’m going to be in the right headspace to engage with this too - between writing the book and my plans for Recurse Center, I’ll be there pretty soon.\nThis year has been a real rollercoaster, but I’m extremely grateful to all my friends and mentors who have helped me during this time."

    "text": "What is Recurse Center?\nThe simplest explanation of what Recurse Center is is that it’s like a writer’s retreat but for programmers. Participants have to apply to get in, and there are 3 stages. The first is a written application, followed by a conversational interview, and then a pair programming interview. Generally, the intention is to assess whether you’ll be a good fit for RC. The selection criteria are stated explicitly on the website, but to summarise, they’re looking for self-motivated people who enjoy programming and are pleasant to be around. It’s not about being an amazing programmer; though I met some people with seriously impressive skills there, I also met newer programmers who were enthusiastic and engaged.\nRC can be attended remotely online or in person, but I opted for the in-person experience to get the most out of it. The hub, the in-person location is in Brooklyn, and takes up 2 floors of an office building. The 4th floor is the main floor where people code, socialise, do pair programming, and hang out in the kitchen, presentation space, or the meeting rooms. The 5th floor is the quiet floor where people can do more focused work without interruption.\nRC has a code of conduct, as well as 4 more general social rules:\n\nNo well-actually’s\nNo feigned surprise\nNo backseat driving\nNo subtle -isms\n\n\n\n\nA printed poster of RC’s social rules\n\n\nAs well as social rules about what not to do, there are 3 guiding principles, or self-directives, about what to do:\n\nWork at the edge of your abilities\nBuild your volitional muscles\nLearn generously\n\nThese explicit expectations lead to a fantastic learning environment where some of the more toxic elements that can sometimes be found in tech were avoided, and folks worked on project that really mattered to them and helped other people do the same.\nRecurse Center is a business, and makes its money from recruitment - RC works with partner companies looking for software engineers and similar roles, though admission to RC isn’t predicated on looking for employment via them, and is never pushed on people."

Working with a tutor has been amazing for helping me identify my strengths (I convey passion and excitement for my topic, and especially when I teach, really try to connect with my audience) and weaknesses (my natural speaking speed is about 3 times what it should be, and I could work on structuring information better within a talk)\nnot to mistake being limited for time to work on a problem with not being able to solve the problem\n\n\n\n\nSome craft projects which were on display at RC"

    "title": "Explaining the C bits at the start of ‘Deep R Programming Ch14: Interfacing compiled code’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "One of my goals for next year is to get a deeper understanding of R’s C API. I’m making a start on this by reading Chapter 14 of Deep R Programming by Marek Gagolewski: “Interfacing compiled code”. It’s a great resource, though the chapter preface states “we assume basic knowledge of the C language”. I do not have this knowledge My C knowledge is fairly limited, and so this blog post will pull out some of the details from that chapter, especially bits where I’ve had to go “wtf is that?!” or remind myself by googling. My current level of C knowledge at the moment is pretty minimal; the main things I know are:\n\nC is a compiled language (as opposed to an interpreted language) and C code needs compiling before it can be run\nA lot of R’s internals are based on C\nC is a statically-type language; this means that variable types are defined when the variable is created and cannot later change other than via explicit manual casting\n\nAnd that’s basically it! I imagine there are other bits I don’t realise I know which I’ve picked up from being an R package maintainer and dabbling in a few C++ tutorials, but I’ll try to explain everything as much as possible. OK, let’s do this!\nThe book chapter provides an example package with a simple C function implemented, and walks us through the code step-by-step. Great!\nSection 14.1.1 starts off with an example of a C function defined in src/cfunc.h. I guess the first thing to note is the location of the file - in the package’s src directory. This is where any compiled code needs to go, typically C or C++ code, or even Fortran if you’re really going old-school.\n\nHeader files and source files\nAnother thing to note here is the file name, which ends in .h. C code can be divided into header files (ending in .h) and source files (ending in .c). Header files contain the function declarations (including variable types) and other things like macros (named bits of code for the pre-processor to work with). They’re sometimes referred to as the interface - they contain information about functions’ inputs and outputs - including the argument names and types.\n\n\nOnce-only includes\nThe first couple of lines of code in the header file contain these lines:\n#ifndef __CFUNS_H\n#define __CFUNS_H\nand the final line is\n#endif\nWhat’s happening here is that, often we can end up with projects containing multiple files, some of which source each other, and include them. We don’t want to end up with duplication of the headers which have been included, otherwise the compiler will raise an error, so we put them in an #ifndef wrapper, and give them a name. Basically, what we’re saying to the preprocessor here is that if this name hasn’t already been defined, defined it and include this code, but if it’s already defined then skip this.\n\n\nIncludes\nThe third line in src/cfunc.h is:\n#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;\nThis allows for the inclusion of a file from the C standard library, which has a few different variables included. The key one for us here is size_t, which is commonly used for iterating over items in arrays - we need this as we’ll be including a for loop in the definition of our function.\n\n\nThe preprocessor\nAbove I casually mentioned the C preprocessor a couple of times without defining it. A succinct and perhaps naive summary is that there are multiple steps in the compilation of C code. One of these phases is preprocessing and it involves things like processing any additional files we’ve said we wanted to include, and replacing macros with their definitions.\n\n\nDeclarations\nSo, the declaration for the function in the example looks like this\ndouble my_c_sum(const double* x, size_t n);\nIn words, this means that:\n\nit is a function which returns an object of type double\nthe function name is my_c_sum\nthe first argument is called x\nx is a pointer to a variable of type double\nx is a const variable, which means it won’t be modified in the body of the function\nthe second argument is called n\nn is of type size_t\n\nThis concept of a pointer just means that x contains the memory address of the double that we pass in, rather than a copy of the values in it. This prevents us from copying the values unnecessarily.\n\n\nSource file\nSource files contain the body of the function, sometimes called the implementation.\nThe code in the book chapter goes on to show the content of the file src/cfuncs.c. The first line of this file is:\n#include \"cfuns.h\"\nThis is including the header file we discussed above. The rest of the code in the source file contains the definition of my_c_sum:\n/* computes the sum of all elements in an array x of size n */\ndouble my_c_sum(const double* x, size_t n)\n{\n    double s = 0.0;\n    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {\n        /* this code does not treat potential missing values specially\n           (they are kinds of NaNs); to fix this, add:\n        if (ISNA(x[i])) return NA_REAL;  // #include &lt;R.h&gt;  */\n        s += x[i];\n    }\n    return s;\n}\nThe function signature here is identical to how it is defined in the header file. The for loop uses the n argument which was passed in to represent the size of the array to loop through. In numerous other languages we’d calculate the size of the array in the body of the function, but in C you cannot have an array of unknown size, and so it must be passed in as a parameter. I think this is to do with how the C compiler allocates memory; more modern C does have the concept of variable-length arrays.\nThe chapter goes on to discuss further examples which then show how to include a wrapper which can be called by R. I won’t discuss this here, as the text there is all explained well, and the contents are more specific to R’s C API, and not specifically just C-related topics.\nHere’s a summary of the C-related topics mentioned here:\n\nheader files and source files\nincludes\nonce-only includes\nthe preprocessor\nvariable-length arrays\nconst variables\npointers\nstatically-typed languages\ncompiled and interpreted languages"

    "text": "As a package maintainer, I’m constantly disappointed when folks mention Arrow bugs they’re aware of but haven’t reported. Not disappointed with the individual in question, but disappointed with the fact that we’re not at the point where we’ve created an environment in which folks are happy to just report bugs immediately. This is not an Arrow-specific problem, and I find myself behaving in exactly the same way with other open source projects. If I’m not entirely sure something is a bug, I’m not going to risk looking foolish publicly by complaining, but the irony of this is that I don’t judge users who make those mistakes with Arrow, as usually it means we need to improve our docs to be more clear, and that in itself is valuable feedback.\nI really love interacting with people who use the package, as without that interaction, development and maintenance can feel like shouting into the void. I like being able to solve problems that make other people’s lives easier, and I thrive off that social energy. I implemented bindings for dplyr::across() because someone commented on Twitter that they’d love to see it as a feature. Last night I got home from a friend’s birthday drinks, saw a user question on Stack Overflow which had an easy win, and within an hour had a pull request up which implemented a new function and fixed the particular issue. I am not promising this level of responsiveness in perpetuity, but I’m still at the point where I find this kind of thing exciting and energising.\nOne particular bug which has haunted me for the past 6 months, is a particularly irritating one whereby when working with a partitioned CSV dataset in arrow (I’m using lowercase to denote the R package, rather than Arrow the overall project), if the user manually specified a schema, the variable used for partitioning did not appear in the resulting dataset. This is a huge problem IMO - while we can sit here all day talking about the virtues of Parquet, in reality, a lot of our users will be using CSVs, and it’s issues like these that can rule out being able to use arrow at all in some cases.\nWhen I opened the original issue based on another user issue, I knew it was important, but felt a bit stuck. It wasn’t immediately obvious to anyone what the source of the error was. I’d assumed it must be a C++ error and flagged it as such, but nobody had taken a look at it, and I’m always hesitant to mindlessly tag folks on issues when I don’t feel like I’ve done the work to investigate (though to be fair, didn’t really know what “the work” should be in this case).\nI’d ended up assuming that this bit of functionality just didn’t work with CSV datasets, and had been working around it, until I was presenting about arrow at New York Open Statistical Programming Meetup, and someone asked about it again. I take 1 user question as representative of 99 other people with the same issue who aren’t being so vocal about it, and felt like it needed to be fixed. I am unashamed to admit that I occasionally have the taste for a bit of melodrama, and publicly declared it to a few of my fellow contributors as “my white whale”, and so set out to find the source, even if it required me to delve deep into the guts of Arrow’s C++ libraries, a task which can often send me down endless rabbit holes and chasing red herrings (this sentence has become quite the nature park…)\nMy original exploration didn’t result in much useful - the arrow package does some cool things with R6 objects to binding them to Arrow C++ objects, but accessing the inner properties of these bound objects would mean manually creating print methods for every single one of them, and when you don’t know in which class the problem lies, this becomes, frankly, a massive pain in the arse. I still didn’t have enough to go on to take it to an Arrow C++ contributor and ask for their help, but showing I’d done some of “the work” to at least make an effort myself.\nAnd then collaborative debugging saved me! I had a catchup with the fantastic Dane Pitkin, and I asked for his help just walking through the problem. Dane’s main contributions to Arrow have been to Python, though he has a ton of previous C++ experience, even if he isn’t a regular contributor to the Arrow C++ library. I walked through the problem with him, and the steps I’d taken so far to try to figure things out, and the fact that I still needed to figure out if the problem was in R or C++. Dane commented that the object bindings we’d been looking at had little surface area for the problem to be in R - most of them were straight-up mappings from the C++ object to an R6 object with no extension. This was my first big clue! I remembered that there’s a bit of open_dataset() where we do some manual reconfiguration of specified options, which involves a whole load of R code - something I’ll come back to later. Dane also suggested I check out Stack Overflow to see if people were complaining about the issue in C++ there. I was sceptical that I’d find anything - lots of these bugs are more often surfaced in the R and Python libraries - but realised that this wasn’t the dead end that I’d thought. It suddenly occurred to me that if I could reproduce the bug in PyArrow, then the problem must lie in the C++ library, but if I couldn’t, then the problem lay in the R code.\nFifteen minutes later, and I had confirmed it was an R problem. I happened to mention on Slack the problem I was having, steps I’d taken so far to investigate, and potential ideas to look at next, and ended up engaging in a bit more collaborative debugging, this time with the wonderful Dewey Dunnington, who mentioned more disparities between PyArrow and R in terms of how we construct schemas, which put me on the path of testing the schema values at different points in Dataset creation and able to rule that out. At that point, with a smaller problem space to explore, the only logical thing left to look into was the R code which sets up the options for the various Arrow classes, and I ended up spotting the rogue instantiation of CSVReadOptions which just needed to have the partitioning column excluded (it relates to the reading in of the individual files which make up the dataset, and so has no “knowledge” of the partitions, and so previously raised an error as it treated them as an extraneous column).\nOne pull request later, and the problem that I’d given myself a week to look at had been solved in less than a day! This is probably one of the most gratifying bugs I’d worked on all year; there was a user with a problem to solve, a bug which had been annoying me for ages, the chance to fall into the puzzle-like aspects of debugging, and some great opportunities for collaboration with folks whose help here I really appreciated. This is one of the things I enjoy most about being a software engineer; this process of starting off feeling entirely clueless about something, and having to work out where I need to be and how I’m going to get there, and then doing it. Actually, in the abstract, that’s probably one of the things I enjoy most about being a human :)"

I suppose my hobby is “pursuing novelty.” The 2022-2023 edition of this came in the form of tabletop role-playing games, and earlier this year, I found myself sitting with some good friends, beers and snacks, working out how my character, “Ach!”, a small goat with a fondness for fainting at inappropriate moments could make their way into a human party undetected.\nThe solution for Ach! and friends was to don a disguise and stand on each others’ shoulders, and this image of 3 goats in a raincoat trying to sneak into a human party perfectly reflects how I feel about myself sometimes as an open source maintainer.\n(Here, I need to get round to commissioning an image of 3 goats in a raincoat standing on each other’s shoulders. The top one has black and red braids and is wearing a hat and fake beard/moustache)\nI am the current maintainer of the arrow R package, which in reality just means I am the person who is listed as such in the package DESCRIPTION file, and have the responsibility of clicking the link in the confirmation email from CRAN when someone submits the latest version of of the package to CRAN. Of course, I do more than just this; I triage bugs, submit patches, review PRs, and occasionally implement new features, but so do other people. While for career-serving purposes, I can technically claim to be “the” maintainer of the package, honestly, I am “a” maintainer and part of a team. This isn’t always reflected in other people’s language, and results in weird moments where people say things to me like, “ah, you wrote arrow!” and I have to respond with, “I absolutely did not, though I did write a lot of the bindings for dplyr::across!”, a topic which subsequently interests me more than it does them."

A lot of it is the perfect storm of adjusting to new responsibility, the deeply unhelpful way in which my self-image when I was younger was built up around being “smart” and “knowing things”, and a knack for punching above my weight by being good at figuring out just enough about a topic to get shit done. I don’t know every single detail of object orientation in R, but I know enough to be able to create new bindings between C++ objects and R6 classes in the arrow R package and expose their methods via fields and active bindings. Despite having looked it up repeatedly over the past few years, I still cannot recall the difference between how things work with static and shared libraries, but I did manage to fix a bug requiring me to bump the version of the C++ date library that Arrow vendors, via inspecting old pull requests and helpful feedback I received on the PR I submitted.\nIt came to a head at this year’s posit::conf, where I had the privilege of co-teaching a workshop about Arrow with the wonderful Stephanie Hazlitt. We spent months preparing materials and practicing teaching to our laptop screens, but when the event itself rolled around, teaching it to a room just shy of 60 people was a different experience entirely. It was intimidating being in front of a room of eager learners, and any jokey asides I was usually capable of making went out of the window, and I just taught the materials fairly plainly, stumbling over my words a bit, and finding the moments of silence in the room as I was teaching pretty awful. Subsequent feedback from folks I trust enough to deliver at least some honesty alongside their validation has led me to conclude that the only person who really noticed or cared about this was me. I was doing my old trick of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, and realised later that my self-expectations were totally unreasonable. While I used to be able to absolutely smash through delivering a well-practiced 2-day “introduction to R” course, and delighted in engaging the folks in the room and showing them what they (and R!) were capable of, it’s 5 years since I last did that on the regular. This was the first time these materials had seen the light of day, and at no less than posit::conf, daunting enough on its own. And honestly, this is all ego. We ran a good workshop, people were engaged, and we wrote some quality reusable materials. Yes, there’s room for improvement, but overall it was solid. Delivery of content is something I can (and will) work on. I’ve applied for The Carpentries instructor training, and have plans to get back into the swing of teaching by running workshops (on Arrow and other topics) at user events."

I managed to escape a lot of this “should” nonsense here, so when one of the course attendees asked me about where to store CSV files to use in unit tests, I happily admitted I wasn’t sure but could find out, and together we had a look in “Writing R Packages”, where I couldn’t find the information, and then suggested the approach I usually take when working on arrow - look at what folks who often define best practices do in the packages that they maintain. We took a look at readr, found the files in the testthat directory, and concluded that unless there’s reason to want to do anything more complicated (like make those datasets available to end users), then that approach is fine. Not knowing the answer instantly wasn’t a hindrance to working out the necessary solution. Learning how to say “I don’t know, but let’s find out together” is one of the most important things I learned when I was first teaching people how to use R. A teacher doesn’t have to know everything, but should be able to help a learner find the information they need."

I spent some time briefly engaging in a bit of pair programming with Jonathan Keane and Neal Richardson, who’ve both been involved with Arrow for a lot longer than me, and I’m always taken aback by just how quickly they both get to the source of a problem any time I ask for help. Part of my “knowledge anxiety” manifests as me sometimes taking longer than I would like to process things when communicating verbally about technical topics, which leads to me getting really frustrated when I’m just not “getting” things in the moment that I know later will seem pretty obvious and uncomplicated. This happened when we were looking at the arrow bug, but I had this sudden moment of clarity upon realising…nobody cared except me. Jon and Neal are great collaborators and are always happy to explain things again if there’s time, and aren’t going to judge me for it.\nI also realised that there is no universal measure of what I should know or where I should be at. While I always want to know more about how things work, I don’t have to know everything and it’s a pretty unrealistic expectation for me to have of myself; sure I can (and often do!) go read a whole load of the codebase and related concepts, but that’ll never be the same as also leaning on other people’s years of experience and knowledge. The whole point of being part of a community is to be able to share both overlapping and divergent knowledge."

Part of the course involved getting acquainted with cmake, and whilst I can’t claim expertise there, dabbling in a bit of the whats and whys helped make many related Arrow project issues seem less mystical.\nReassurance and validation are good and well, but in my experience, having tangible proof of the things that I do know is more effective."

I can say without a doubt that pretending to be fine would have made things infinitely worse.\nThere was another point during the conference when I casually mentioning that I was feeling quite hopeful about a potential opportunity but not entirely sure if it was in the bag, as I suspected I might be up against someone whose background I find impressive. It was kindly pointed out to me that each of us bring different things to the table, a comment which has since set off a chain reaction of me starting to appreciate what I can do rather than what I can’t."

However, what I do like about this is that I have a specific place to store my prompts - in a GitHub repo - where I can iterate on them and track changes over time.\nI also like that I now have a deployable artifact that I can share with others - I had mentioned to other members of the R-Ladies Global Team that I had been using LLMs to generate social media posts for promoting our news and blog posts, and this means I can easily share the link to the repo with the app, instead of having to share a prompt. Creating this as a distinct project encourages collaboration, whether that’s on which parameters we want to include in the app, or improving the quality of the prompts."

Specifically, I’m referring to the examples included as part of function documentation. In my experience, the best way for me to achieve rapid familiarity with an R function I haven’t worked with before, or understand how to use a function about which I already understand the basics, is by having example code that I can run. In the book ‘R Packages’, Hadley Wickham remarks that examples are “a very important part of the documentation because many people look at the examples first” and rOpenSci recommend that each of a package’s exported functions should be accompanied by examples.\nIn this blog post, I will explore the things that I believe make for good function examples in documentation, focussing mainly on R."

    "text": "What good looks like in R\nI asked people on Twitter for their opinions of good R package documentation in general, and Jonathan Sinclair highlighted the ‘examples’ section from dplyr::case_when, the beginning of which is shown below.\n\n\n\n(image from: https://rdrr.io/cran/dplyr/man/case_when.html)\n\n\nI think Jonathan is spot on in his assessment. To paraphrase, the highlights for him are:\n\nthere is next to no prose or intro\nthere are plenty of comments, as needed, to explain the examples\nthere is a variety of different examples\nthere are examples of what not to do.\n\nThis kind of documentation appeals to my skim-reading self. If I’m trying to accomplish a task, sometimes I just want to run some code and see what happens to get an intuitive feel for what a function does. While I am fully prepared to slow down and read the rest of the documentation, a “quick win” motivates me to invest the additional effort. It tells me that the developers of this code have prioritised making things easy to understand and that the time I am investing will pay off.\nI’ve been skimming through the documentation of some tidyverse and related packages - as I consider many of these to be well documented and easy to read. Here are some things I’ve observed which I think one can do to make function examples look great:\n\ninclude the most basic usage of a function\nuse very simple toy datasets or standard in-built datasets\ndemonstrate non-obvious behaviours of a function\ndemonstrate different parameter values/combinations where relevant\ndemonstrate any unusual parameters\ndemonstrate on different objects if appropriate\nsometimes go beyond the use of an individual function to include common mini-workflows\ngroup documentation and examples for similar functions together\ninclude examples that may lead to unexpected results\ninclude comments to explain examples\nno examples for deprecated functions to discourage their use\nno unpredictable external dependencies - rvest::html_text manually creates HTML to demonstrate capabilities rather than scraping an external site\nsometimes showing the output when it adds to the example (e.g. tidyselect::starts_with() and many other examples from that package)\nexamples should be correct and run without error (unless intended to show erroneous output)"

    "section": "What good looks like generally",
    "text": "What good looks like generally\nWhen reading through examples, one thing that struck me is that when I’m looking at Python docs in Jupyter Notebook (press shift + tab), I also see the output of running the examples.\n\nSimilarly, both examples and outputs are shown in the official docs for some libraries, for example, pandas.\n\nI think this is a helpful feature - less effort is required to see how a function works.\nIn R function documentation, runnable code is often included, but in most cases needs to be manually run by the reader to see the output. I’m torn as to whether this is good or not. On the one hand, it encourages you to run the code and get a more tangible feel for what it does and saves valuable space in the Viewer window in RStudio. On the other hand, it adds an extra manual step to your workflow and lengthens the time until that precious “quick win” of enlightenment when exploring a new function.\nYou get a lot closer to this on the website rdrr.io, which indexes R package documentation and allows examples to be run inline. However, examples are run one after the other without the original code being displayed. So in the case of multiple examples, you have to match up the output to which example it is from.\n\n\n\n(from https://rdrr.io/cran/dplyr/man/case_when.html)\n\n\nSome packages include output as comments within their examples. For instance, the tidyselect package; here’s an example from tidyselect::all_of:\n\n\n\n(from https://rdrr.io/cran/tidyselect/man/all_of.html)\n\n\nAll that said, while the ability to see the output of examples is a nice-to-have, I don’t think it’s essential to good function documentation. With any piece of documentation, it’s necessary to consider the purpose; at a minimum, examples exist to tell the reader how to use a function, and you don’t need to see the output to do that.\nSince I first wrote this, I found out that it is possible to easily run examples from help files by selecting them and then hitting Ctrl+Enter, the same as running code in the Source pane.\n\nAnother thing I wasn’t aware of - pkgdown - commonly used to automatically render docs for packages run examples and displays the output underneath. Check out the example below from the Arrow pkgdown site.\n\nIn conclusion, good examples make functions easier to work with and help readers of your documentation gain a deeper understanding of how a function works. While any examples are better than no examples, you can give your users the best chance of success when using your code with careful thought about the content of your documentation.\nHuge thanks to everyone who responded to my Twitter thread, and to my fantastic colleague Joris Van den Bossche for reading the first draft of this, and our conversations about how things are done in R and Python."
