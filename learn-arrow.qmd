Resources for learning how to work with larger-than-memory data in R using Arrow and Parquet:


- **Reference:** The [Arrow R package documentation](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/){target="_blank"} covers installation and function reference.

- **Learning:** [The book](#the-book) takes you from the basics through to optimising large-scale workflows, and is free to read online.

- **Hands-on:** I run [public workshops](#public-workshops) with exercises and 1:1 help, and also offer [private training](#private-training) for teams.

## The Book {#the-book}

*Scaling Up with R and Arrow* is available to read online for free at [arrowrbook.com](https://arrowrbook.com){target="_blank"}. I wrote it with Jonathan Keane and Neal Richardson, and it covers everything from getting started with Arrow to optimising large-scale data workflows.

## Public Workshops {#public-workshops}

I run public workshops on working with larger-than-memory data in R using Arrow and Parquet. You'll learn how to:

-   Analyse larger-than-memory data using dplyr syntax you already know
-   Convert CSVs into space-saving Parquet files
-   Optimise datasets to take full advantage of your hardware

The workshops are hands-on with exercises to help you apply what you've learned. Attendee numbers are capped to keep things interactive with opportunities for 1:1 help.

## Private Training {#private-training}

I also deliver private workshops for teams. If you'd like to discuss training for your organisation, email me at [nic\@ncdatalabs.com](mailto:nic@ncdatalabs.com).
